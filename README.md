# Extended-Histogram-of-Gradients

Here, I provide 2 implementations of ExHoG in C/C++ and MATLAB. The C/C++ versions includes both SVM and Asymmetric Principal Component Analysis + Mahalanobis Distance classifier implementation in Linux. Windows versions are unavailable. If needed, use the MATLAB version which is for Windows. However, the MATLAB version only provides the feature creation part. The classifiers can be easily implemented in MATLAB and thus, there is no need for providing scripts of libraries for that.
